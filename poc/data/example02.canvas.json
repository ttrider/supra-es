This puts Lucene in a tricky spot, since many queries need to accumulate temporary state/statistics associated with the index it is being used against, but the Query contract mandates that it must be immutable. To get around this, Lucene asks each query to generate a Weight object which acts as a temporary context object to hold state associated with this particular (IndexSearcher, Query) tuple.

This puts Lucene in a tricky spot, since many queries need to accumulate temporary state/statistics associated with the index it is being used against, but the Query contract mandates that it must be immutable. To get around this, Lucene asks each query to generate a Weight object which acts as a temporary context object to hold state associated with this particular (IndexSearcher, Query) tuple.

Some queries have faster or slower initialization of the Scorer, depending on optimizations, complexity, etc. This may also show timing associated with caching, if enabled and/or applicable for the query"

The second phase verification is what the matches statistic measures. For example, a phrase query first checks a document approximately by ensuring all terms in the phrase are present in the doc. If all the terms are present, it then executes the second phase verification to ensure the terms are in-order to form the phrase, which is relatively more expensive than just checking for presence of the terms.
